# Graph Library

Find shortest path for operational points, assumes that graph files are generated by RInfLoader.

Cost function is the estimated traveltime, length of section of line multiplied by max speed.

The path actually taken by a train may be slightly different.

Calculating routes with high accuracy, requires further data about the connectivity within each operational point (see [Leveraging Semantic Technologies for Digital Interoperability in the European Railway Domain](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/978-3-030-88361-4_38?sharing_token=1o_s7PDoV39x-REbzrEi9fe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6cX0iMBo8kbKm6MVocmAfla1lOS3pIKdJnlGw_p7Hlarek_nfbMrdg2IEYVlyrg7UoC8_O5QAzne-G1waJIuD4K6xSNHF9bK26QKM6niEPNUKiwT_oLJLoafQwuYM5Z2I%3D)).
